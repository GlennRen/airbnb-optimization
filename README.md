# Airbnb Optimization
Price &amp; bookings optimization tool for Airbnb. Submission for Capital One Software Engineering Summit.

## Deliverables
1. **Visualize the data:** Graph some (any 3) interesting metrics, maps, or trends from the dataset.
2. **Price estimation:** Given the geo-location (latitude &amp; longitude) of a new property, estimate the weekly average income the homeowner can make with Airbnb.
3. **Bookings optimization:** Given the geo-location (latitude &amp; longitude) of a new property, what is the ideal price per night that will yield maximum bookings or revenue?

## Bonuses
* **Animate:** Add an animation to your visualization.
* **Investment:** If I have $100 million to invest, where in San Francisco should I buy properties so I can maximize my returns with Airbnb? When will I break even?
* **Popularity:** Can you identify the neighborhood that averages the most positive reviews?
