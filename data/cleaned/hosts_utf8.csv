4921,Kevin,12/8/08,"San Francisco, California, United States","I love being a host. I have been happily inviting guests into my home since the dawn of airbnb, way back in 2008. It was so early that airbnb had no employees yet, and one of the three co-founders had to come to my house to take the 'professional pictures' that come with membership. Since I am a photographer, he didn't take the pictures because he thought mine were better than he could take. Instead, we spent 20 minutes talking about airbnb. I knew it was going to be huge even back then.I hosted the first airbnb employee, Nick. The founders required potential employees to use the service, and Nick chose my house. He later got hired, stayed until he vested all his stock, and last I heard is now an investor, using the windfall he accumulated by being the first employee at what is now a company reportedly worth more than USD twenty five billion. You can find the review Nick left for me in the reviews section.I have been to France, Germany, Austria, Jamaica, China, Japan, Thailand, Switzerland, England, Greece, Belgium, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy, among others.It's easy to get here. You can fly into either the San Francisco or Oakland International airports. From there you can take BART, the regional train that serves the San Francisco Bay Area. BART will get you into San Francisco itself, since the airports are not actually in the City. Once you exit the BART station, you hop on a MUNI bus #36, which you catch right at the exit of the BART station... no walking. Then, you get off the #36 and you are right at my front door, again, no walking.There is plenty of free unlimited time parking in front of my house.Prior to becoming a bed and breakfast host, I was a software entrepreneur and computer programmer. I have been in the tech field through two boom/bust cycles.I am also an accomplished photographer and if you ask, I'll take your picture.If you arrive on Friday or Saturday, I prefer you don't arrive after 7pm, so that I don't have to stay home waiting for you. I have a live in girlfriend and I like to take her out on dates.Final thoughts: You can learn a lot from my profile here and from my hundreds of reviews. I strive to provide my guests with an incredible San Francisco experience. Almost every guest is happy, which shines through in my reviews I think. But a rare few are unhappy. If you think you'll be unhappy as well, perhaps because this is a traditional old house built in 1958 with oak wood floors that squeak, small original bathrooms with worn tile, original noisy plumbing, thin walls, and often a dozen or more guests per night... then please book somewhere else. There are plenty of newer homes on airbnb. I have almost 100% occupancy, so I won't be offended or financially harmed if you book somewhere else. Rather, I will be happy, because it pains me to read the rare review where someone complains about something that is entirely normal for most San Francisco houses. What you get when staying here is a richly fascinating window into real San Francisco life, high on a magnificent hill with a stunning view onto acres of untouched forested land, a rarity in bustling and congested San Francisco. You also get to meet me, one of the most experienced hosts on this platform. I signed up just four months after airbnb was founded, and I host over one thousand guests per year when I am hosting. Some years I take a break. I will help you out more than most hosts, and the 'special features' of my six bedroom home should be viewed as perks not quirks... perks that will help you soak up the uncommon feeling of living in what many say is the best city in the United States.In conclusion, I want to mention price. This is essentially a hostel in an old house with free food and a very attentive host to help you make the most of your visit. So, the price should be affordable. Usually it is, but not always. If you book during a special event, like the Super Bowl (held here in 2016) or the Outside Lands concert or Oracle World, the price could be double or quadruple the normal price. Remember, hotels in San Francisco that cost $200 a night can jump to $1,000 or $2,000 a night during one of the big events. While I don't ever charge $1,000, I do charge more when special events are in the area. Please don't pay my asking price, stay here and then complain when you leave a review that the price is not a good value. I sell out nearly every night of the year, so that means I am pricing my rooms below market. Hotels strive to only have about a 70 to 80 percent occupancy, I have read, because that level of occupancy optimizes profit. I strive to optimize for 100 percent occupancy, even though it means lower profit per room. I like 100 percent occupancy because that way I get to meet the most people, which I enjoy. I also want to help my guests meet the most people from around the world as well. If I optimize for profit, my guests meet fewer people. So that's why I optimize prices to fill every room every night. When you stay here, you can be certain you are paying a fair and market rate price that is lower than it could be if I tried to make the most profit.In this profile I have disclosed clearly significant negatives to my listings - that this is a hostel with many guests per night, that the house is old and tired, etc.... But despite these negatives, I run a tight ship and my guests are very happy almost all the time, as you can read in my 400+ reviews.I strive to achieve five stars across all the rating categories, and I am close to getting there, with a 92% five star ranking as of February 18th, 2016. I am also an airbnb Superhost, which you can see by the yellow and red badge in various locations including just below this profile text. This status means the following: 1) I have never cancelled a reservation in the last year; 2) I reply to at least 90% of messages from prospective guests within 24 hours; 3) that I have had at least ten bookings in the last year; 4) that at least 80% of guests in the last three months prior to evaluation have rated their overall stay here with five stars out of a possible five stars. If you don't see the badge, that means I have temporarily lost my status and forgot to update this text. It is very difficult to achieve Superhost status in a shared house with so many guests, which I mention so you will appreciate why I have the house rules you see in my listings. If you are difficult to please in general, or find that you frequently leave tough reviews on review sites such as Yelp, please stay somewhere else. I work very hard to get and keep Superhost status, and for almost all guests, that work results in the sweet and heartfelt reviews you see. Note I exceed the Superhost minimum requirements because I reply to every guest message, I have hundreds of bookings per year and I have never cancelled on a guest ever.Again, I urge you to stay somewhere else if you find yourself to be picky and/or think you'll penalize me for the qualities I have disclosed to you in this profile. I will be grateful if you refrain from leaving a review where you repeat the negatives I have plainly disclosed here.I really enjoy being a host. I want to meet you. I have wonderful guests, and I have made many friends over the years. People from over 44 countries have stayed with me. You'll meet people from other places... interesting people. If something goes wrong, I will go out of my way to help you. If you forget your toothbrush, I'll give you a new one. If you flight is delayed and you get to my door at 3am, I'll still greet you with a smile and show you around. If you get sick, I'll drive you to a clinic for healthcare. If you need to print something you can use my free printer I have for guests. I will take care of you even more than the concierge at a five star hotel. Here are two examples: 1) The father of my guest packed their prescription eye medicine in their checked luggage, and that luggage was delayed. The guest's father had to have the medication, and his doctor was overseas, so my guest could not easily get a new prescription to buy the same medicine locally. My guest also spoke English only at a basic level. He asked me to call the airline. I called them, and the next day I drove my guest and his father to an obscure business park in another city to pick up his bag in an unmarked office building. The medicine was in the bag and my guest and my guest's father were thrilled. 2) A family from the Netherlands visited to go tent camping for a few weeks. They had their gear shipped to my house before their arrival. I stored the boxes in my garage at no cost. Then when they tried to rent a van their credit card did not have enough available credit for the mandatory deposit they had not been informed about when they reserved the van. They called their bank in Holland and learned it would take five days to boost their credit limit, which would have ruined their vacation. I went with them to the car rental company and charged their rental to my credit card. When they returned the van, they used their newly capable card to settle the bill and I did not lose any money. I can't promise to do this for every guest, of course, but they were doctors with teenage kids. I evaluated the credit risk and felt comfortable helping them out. Of course, this family was extremely grateful, because otherwise they would have had to find a place to stay while they waited for their bank to raise their credit line. I was booked solid, so I could not have extended their visit with me. I've been helping my guests like this for years now, and I have so much fun in the process. Hope to see you soon!I reply very, very quickly to all inquiries and requests, usually within 5 minutes, 16 hours a day from 8am to midnight my time, 365 days a year. I don't allow Instant Book because I like to manually review everyone that stays here. This is a shared house and I take care to provide a great experience for my other guests. If I am uncomfortable with a potential guest I will not let them stay here. But just because I don't allow Instant Book, you may confirm your plans very quickly because I will reply quickly from 8am to midnight my time. Since I joined airbnb in 2008 my average response time according to airbnb is just five minutes. Note when I say 'uncomfortable with a potential guest' I am talking about qualities such as not following my 'house rules.' I am not suggesting I discriminate because I welcome guests from every country on Earth.I am registered as a host with department of short term rentals San Francisco, and I have a San Francisco business license as required. I also pay Property Tax to San Francisco on all my airbnb household furnishings. And of course, I pay State and Federal income taxes on my airbnb earnings.",100%,t,Inner Sunset,2

Ive lived in California my whole life and have traveled the world extensively. I moved to the SF Mission District the summer of 2009 from San Luis Obispo where I was for 12 years and before that I was in So-Cal, Anaheim. I absolutely love living in SF and even more being in the Mission District.At age 21, I started a business (URL HIDDEN) (URL HIDDEN) which fulfills insurers responsibilities for auto losses involving car stereo theft. By some miracle and hard work we celebrated 35 years. I virtualized the company office in 2010 allowing all of my employees to work from home and tele commute to our virtual office. I haven't looked back since. What a truly incredible times we are living in.I am an avid traveler, an amateur chef and enjoy Bikram yoga. I LOVE being an AirBnB Super HOST and take the job seriously. I also sing on Sundays as a member of the ensemble at Glide SF (URL HIDDEN) I ride a bicycle as my preferred mode of transport. I enjoy cycling around SF and out to the beach or Marin. Im very social in a home based style. My daily routine starts a 5AM. I work a bit and then go to yoga (Mission Yoga) 1.5 blocks away about 6:05 for a 90 minute hot yoga class. I come home and have breakfast and spend the rest of the morning doing chores and of course running my company online. Dinner time comes early 6ish, and then I watch a foreign film or catch up on reading. I turn in at 9 or 9:30PM. This is not to say that I am inflexible for social invitations but a routine works well for me and I love my sleep.As for my place, the location and views are arguably the best the Mission District could offer. The private roof deck a green oasis for the otherwise concrete jungle of a Mission Street residence. My residence faces west so it's on the street side and is usually quite noisy from the street people, traffic and sirens. I sleep with earplugs and wouldn't move anywhere else. The sun always seems to shine in the Mission. The three bedrooms are all well sized and comfortably appointed two having queen size beds, and the third a Twin bed. All have dressers and side tables and the closets are built out.Here are a couple of links to local online local rags that are very informative about the happenings in the Mission and throughout San Francisco and my AirBnB offer listings;(URL HIDDEN)(URL HIDDEN)My AirBnB room offers;https://admin.airbnb.com/rooms/856123https://admin.airbnb.com/rooms/(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)",100%,t,Mission District,2

Happy to share recommendations on the arts, cultural, music, dining, and bar scenes.My approach to hosting is guided by own travel experiences at various lodgings. What I found missing so often in my stays was a sense of warmth and place. So when I went to work on designing my own lodging experience, I was mindful of incorporating artwork, quality lighting, soothing colors and textures, tropical plants, and high-end comforts. After all, you don't put up with shabby sheets, pillows, blankets, and towels at home, so why should you downgrade when traveling?Consider me your local contact and friend for help with all things San Francisco. Better than at any hotel, really, because unlike the help downtown, I live in the heart of city rather than the ex-urbs, and I don't receive compensation from restaurants, bars, or galleries in return for my recommendations.San Francisco and Mission District neighborhood resident since 2003 -- originally from Seattle. Guests' Bill of Rights and Expectations1. Your reservation is secure. I only accept a reservation if I'm sure I can honor it and the dates absolutely work for me.2. Your privacy. I won't need to enter your room and will not do so without your knowledge and consent.3. You're not subject to my personal life. You can expect that I will not have my friends and family hanging around.4. A friendly, welcoming atmosphere. You can expect that I will leave the porch light on for you.5. New and premium sheets and towels.6. Clear communication to set expectations, offer feedback, and apprise you of my plans and schedule.7. A clean living  space in a curated environment.8. An atmosphere that is respectful, flexible, and collaborative.9. Customer support to get you oriented and offer recommendations.10. A ""thermostat"" host experience that allows you the option of company over morning coffee and evening dinners or the freedom to go your own way. My News and airbnb insider tips, updated July 2014.

Summer Season of free Sunday outdoor concerts in Stern Grove announced with a heavy soul - R&B line up;February 2014, attended masked Mexican ""lucha libre"" wrestling in the Mission District with the guest I'm hosting;January 2014, when booking for more than two weeks, you can often secure the best price by reserving at the monthly rate and save money even if you can't use all 30 nights;December 2013, always ask any potential host how many units are in the building and what any neighbors within the building are like. It's also entirely within your right to ask if the neighbors are on board with the airbnb experience;November 2013, one of the leading causes of hosts cancelling reservations at the last minute is a landlord finding out about an unapproved airbnb situation. Ask your prospective host if they are a renter and what they can do for you should they need to cancel;  October 2013, a last minute cancellation by a prospective host is the easiest thing that can go wrong on airbnb, since the penalties are relatively minor. Ask your host if he has cancelled on guests before and what certainty s/he can provide that your reservation will not be cancelled; September 2013, this is the final month to catch SF as the host city for America's Cup Race of multi-million dollar sail boats on the north waterfront overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island.April 2013, Now is the best time to view the storied California poppy, in full bloom on the sun-facing slopes of the Bay Area hills surrounding San Francisco.Feb. 2013, Noise Pop rocks the Mission with free shows daily at Benders -- a  dive bar Smithsonian of local grit capturing the days before the Mission gentrified. Oct. 2012, the line up for the Hardly Strictly free music festival in Golden Gate Park Oct. 5 - 7 has been announced and includes free perfomances by Dwight Yoakam and the reunited Son Volt. September 2012,  Backpacking Montana wilderness.March 2012, Tapped by airbnb to participate in a demonstration project and provide advice on labs features for enhancing the site's user experience.Feb. 2012, Beginning outline of chapters for online direct-to-market independent book with working title ""Complete Host's Guide to Success on Airbnb.""Jan. 2012, Back from three weeks traveling Mexico on airbnb with a renewed sense of what makes for a good stay and what a guest wants.Oct. 2011, People get ready as LitQuake (Oct. 7 thru Oct. 15) is poised to overtake the Mission and SF with smart readings and many a glass held high, culminating in LitCrawl on Oct. 15.Sept. 2011, the line up for the Hardly Strictly free music festival in Golden Gate Park Sept. 30 - Oct. 2 has been announced and includes Merle Haggard, Robert Plant, Bob Mould, and Thurston Moore!Aug. 2011, just returned from 5 nights of backpacking the North Cascades about 5 miles south of the Canadian Border.",N/A,f,Mission District,2

I work way too far from home so that grouches my life a pinch, but a glass of wine, good friends and music placates most of life's wrinkles. I've traveled 'round the world, and was lucky enough to call London, Brussels, Barcelona home for a time. People, places and experiences fascinate me, and Airbnb helps to satiate my yearnings to see the world until I am able to venture off to new far flung places. If you're moving here, I can likely help with ideal 'hoods you might want to investigate. I've lived in multiple places in SF and love real estate and helping people find a place. ",100%,t,Pacific Heights,1

Keep this helpful hints in mind:1. Holidays and summer weekends book up months in advance. 2. If it's less than a month before any kind of holiday, concert, or event, it's likely already booked up. Accommodations in Indio and Palms Springs sell out within the HOUR of Coachella tickets going on sale, but it's the same two weekends every year, so plan ahead and you'll get what you want.3. You can book as far as 13 months out.4. If you book more than 10 months out, there is a 7-night minimum.5. If you want to book a Friday or a Saturday, there is a three-night minimum -- unless you are booking within 48 hours of check-in (4pm). Very occasionally I am able to accommodate shorter weekend stays. It doesn't hurt to ask, but please don't be disappointed if I must say no. I have units that can accommodate as many as eight people. Have more than eight? You can rent more that one unit! The Maximum Occupancy listed on the listing is as true as gravity and cannot be adjusted for any reason because the Fire Marshal said so. Respect the Fire Marshal's wisdom.Almost all units have a complete kitchen. In addition to full-size appliances, you'll find plates, glasses, silverware, and other kitchen items. All linens, including towels, are included. You have access to all resort amenities -- that means the pool, the hot tub, the gym, free parking, etc.Sadly, the resorts do not allow pets.Wifi is $4.95/day or $15.95/stay. This is 100% a resort fee that I have 0% control over.This is a timeshare. Someone at the resort might (but probably won't) try to talk you into buying a timeshare. They'll even give you a present if you say yes! Saying yes means dealing with them for the next two hours, and that's *not* why you went on vacation. BE SMART - SAY NO - GO ENJOY YOUR VACATION! :)We've had too many bad experiences with guests from Orange County, California. If you are a current or former resident of Orange County and would like to rent from us, kindly be kind in your messages; we'll get the hint that you're a decent person and will welcome you with open arms.***Feel good about your vacation!

Chris is a musician who works in a local nightclub, and I'm (Tex) a writer for an animal/environmental/human rights website. We're both huge animal and music lovers.We absolutely love living in San Francisco, and are super excited about opening our home to Airbnb guests. We've stayed at Airbnb rentals a few times, and had great experiences each time. We hope to provide that same greatness to our guests. Well, almost as (URL HIDDEN) of the times we rented a tugboat in Sausalito, CA, and believe it or not, ended up saving the captain from a sinking plane that crashed into the Bay before our very eyes. True story! While we can't promise that level of thrill, we can promise to do our best to make sure our guests have a great stay:) One thing we look for in an Airbnb rental; privacy. Our place has plenty of that. The space we're offering is completely separate from our residence, including how guests enter/exit. We are totally down to help visitors when needed, but also appreciate that many people just want to check in, then be left alone. We are prepped do to either, depending on the guest:)We put a lot of work into creating the space that you're considering staying in. It's comfortable, peaceful, and really cool inside. Our hope is to earn enough income from this listing to finish fixing up our vintage 63' Shasta trailer, which we hope to list on Airbnb in the near future. It's currently parked in our big backyard, and in decent shape, but of course, we want it to be in great shape before we start offering it up to guests. So hopefully that will happen before long, so larger groups can stay with us and have two units to share!I'm really big on biking and hiking in the Bay, so I'd be glad to help visitors figure out best places to go to experience the Bay Area outdoors. Chris and I are both really into the local art and music scene, so we're both happy to point out great shows to attend if you're looking for nightlife ideas.Friends who test stayed in our new guest space downstairs joked about not wanting to leave. It's really a special space, and for folks who are cool with staying in a neighborhood that is a slice of real San Francisco, with people of all colors, that's got grit and character to it, this space is for you. Though a bit isolated, it's really easy to get to other parts of San Francisco and the rest of the Bay Area from our location, since we're close to both main highways; 280 and 101 for those with cars, and close to the T train and buses for the car-less guests. Throw in the sunniest weather in the city, and you've got a few reasons why we are so proud to call the Bayview our home. We look forward to meeting you!",100%,f,Bayview,1

I have been a traveler all my life, from the time I was 6 months old and it is a great pleasure to open my very unique home to other fellow adventurers.      I adore people....all kinds and all ages and as a host I will welcome you and I am willing to be your guide to this wonderful city or let you discover it for yourself. I do my best to be sensitive to what it is that you want from your stay and to provide you with a warm, welcoming and peaceful sanctuary from where you can explore this incredible city.   I work at home as an artist and so have a very flexible schedule that allows me to be available for check ins and visiting with my guests if they like to visit. I live with my sweetheart, Fast Freddy Sims who is a very talented blues musician, songwriter, artist and landscape designer. My three children come and go (25, 22 and 20). I would describe our household as a loving, kind family who are very passionate and dedicated to creative self-expression and the arts.    I have lived in Italy, England, Brazil, and Mexico and traveled to Greece, Scotland, Peru,Germany, Holland, Portugal, Spain, the Seychelles, the Caribbean, France and there are probably countries that I am forgetting. My style of traveling has changed throughout the years and so I believe that I understand and am open to travelers of all types.   I love being an Airbnb host for a multitude of reasons. These include what I see as a new culture and community that Airbnb has given birth to. For me it means being part of a loving and inspiring perspective that views the world and all people in it as part of one human family.  I have discovered that we are so often connected in ways that are wonderful and enriching and delightfully surprising!! I am passionate about the importance of hospitality in our interactions with others! A little bit about my ART; I am a Contemporary Symbolist.    I create art to heal myself and others and work with prayer, meditation and sacred symbols and archetypes to reweave and re-story my life in a way that is legendary, passionate, joyful and ALIVE!!My art depicts a spiritual journey, the telling of a story that contactsthe viewer at the level of the soul. My art inspires others to look more deeply at the work and at themselves as they view layers and layers of prayer,hope, paradox and spirit woven together between particles of paint, bead, rhinestone, shell, bone and glitter. As a teacher, I encourage my students to explore materials that animate their sense of wonder, joy and play. By playing with the sparkle of jewels, beads & glitter the divine sparkle of imagination that lives within them is awakened and they gain access to their own healing and personal transformation. Creating in this way leads to the understanding of how the sacred exists in matter and this wisdom integrates the spiritual, emotional and physical selves. My world view is that of a symbolist. I am present to the meaning in all aspects of life.    I am a trained energy healer as well as being a visionary artist and teacher. I maintain the energy of our home with a beautiful array of different techniques, including working with the Archangels and clearing heavy, dense energy with sacred sage spray, blessings and prayers. I love to add extra blessings for all my guests so that their stay in my home is peaceful, relaxed and joyful. It is a delight to me to hear how well people sleep and how wonderful they feel when they are visiting.  I believe that the greatest gift of my life is the presence of other people in it and your presence in my home is a gift  that I am grateful for.     ",100%,t,Richmond District,3

We've been Airbnb hosts in San Francisco for more than three years, and we really like doing it. We also like to use Airbnb whenever we travel.Q: Are you a hyper-talkative, super-social person? Is that why this portion of your profile is so long?A: Not really. I'm not much of a partier or talker. Especially when I'm a guest in someone else's house. I don't expect anyone to read everything I've written in this box. But if they'd like to read it, here it is.Q: Gotcha. When did you become a dad?A: Late 2008.Q: Is your son amazing? You have two now, right?A: Yes, we now have two sons. Both are amazing. The second boy was born in early January 2011, two weeks after his due date. If he'd been born just a few days earlier, we would have received an additional $1,000 break on our 2010 taxes! Oh well....Q: Are you a tax expert? Is that what you do?A: No. I work as an art director and editor at a small publishing company in SF's Mission District. Q: When did you move to San Francisco?A: 2008. We moved from Brooklyn NY, where we'd lived since '02.Q: Where in San Francisco do you live?A: We live in a neighborhood called Bayview that doesn't get talked about very much. Our house is southeast of the Mission, south of the Dogpatch, and east of Bernal Heights. Tourists don't often get out to Bayview, so its charmsplaygrounds, restaurants, coffee spotsare more or less undiscovered. Bayview is a great place to live and raise a family. I ride my bike into the Mission for work every day, and the ride is less than 15 minutes. It's a flat ride, too. (In SF, a city notorious for its hills, that flatness is a big deal.) Bayview is the most neighborly neighborhood I've lived in. Many people who live on our street know my wife and sons by name. It's just nice.Q: Where are you from originally?A: I was born in Toledo, Ohio and lived there for most of my childhood, with detours in Cleveland and South Carolina. I went to college at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN. I met my wife Katie at IU.Q: Did you like Brooklyn? Why did you leave?A: We loved Brooklyn. We had good jobs and many friends there. At the end of 2007 I was offered a great job, out of the blue, in SF. We couldn't turn it down, even though the prospect of a cross-country move was a bit scary. Q: Scary?A: The idea of going from two salaries to one salary was a little scary. The funniest thing about our move to SF was this: Two days after I quit my job in Brooklyn, we found out my wife was pregnant with our first son! Yikes. In light of this happy pregnancy news, we considered calling off the big cross-country move, but in the end we decided to bite the bullet and jump. I'm glad we did. The move was rough. But we made it through a tough first year and SF now feels like home.",100%,f,Bayview,1

Getting to meet new guests everyday -- and the trust inherent in that process -- brings me a lot of joy. While I'm originally from the east coast, I moved to San Francisco 22 years ago and it's my home now.  San Francisco is heaven on earth -- a magical place with a collective spirit of diversity, creativity, and open-mindedness.I'm currently getting a PhD in sociology at UC Davis. My recent research has focused on elites and education, and currently I'm researching women in high tech.

My favorite films are The Station Agent, American Beauty, and, most recently, Boyhood. My favorite documentary is Baraka. Travel is pretty much in my blood. I sometimes just have to get away to spark creativity. I have driven across country twice. I've been to Cuba, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia and, most recently, Japan. I love meeting new people and enjoy hearing about people's lives. So I hope we will have a chance to talk while you're here!I love good food too.

I am also up on the best venues to see music in the city if you're interested in that.In terms of my style as a host, I tend to be pretty attuned to my guests' needs. I can usually sense if they need my help with things, in which case I am always happy to provide any guidance. I like to give guests plenty of space to have their own experience here, so you won't find me being overbearing and asking for your time. I'm pretty quiet and spend a lot of time in my room reading or working. But I do love to have chats with the guests to find out where they've been that day and how they liked it, and particularly if they tried any of the recs I provided. The bottom line is I love to have guests in my home.

With friends, family and guests I have an open door policy in that, my home is your home. I take a lot of pride in the place I live and have worked hard to make it a cozy but stylish home. I was raised by incredible parents that are still happily married..I operate under the simple guidelines of basic respect and reciprocity and understand that you don't just leave things as you found them, you leave them better than before when possible. If you take advantage of the finer things in life, you have to contribute to the pool of greatness by paying it forward as much as possible. I am fair, fun and easy to communicate with but also respect distance and silence. When I travel I take each day and adventure as it comes. Sometimes some of the greatest memories come from the most unplanned, expectation-less and unrestricted spirit. I value having a warm, safe place to hang our coats and rest my head. I like the feel of comfort, family and pride in ones home.

One may mistaken Woody Allen as my travel agent since my travel cravings consist of cities by night with good food (both refined and street food), grand and quaint architecture, rich culture and places to dance: i.e. Paris, Barcelona, Florence, Rome, New York, Shanghai, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, London, Rio, Buenos Aires.  I am a Wes Anderson type traveler as I love quirky hidden gems in big cities; especially when I stumble upon something that seems out of place.

I lived in New York immediately out of college for Fashion Design, Beijing and Taiwan for studies and have stayed in Italy, Spain and France for extended work/leisure trips.

From the rich landscape of rolling hills to it's fine dining culture. It is a city of innovators, artists, professionals, intellects, travelers and most of all, community.

I also like to go for a run early in the morning before most people are awake.  It gives me the perspective from the street and helps me learn the lay of the land.  It also allows me to watch the city or countryside wake up and take form.  A couple of my favorite places to run have been Istanbul, Turkey (along the water) and Udaipur, India (in Gandhi Park).  In addition to traveling, I also love to spend time in my hometown with my friends and family.

To get away, I enjoy a trip down to Monterrey Bay or Half Moon Bay.  I am a huge movie buff and love to watch comedies, romantic comedies, and action flicks.  As a host---I am happy to share with you the hot spots in SF, food and sights!   I love to get to know other people and enjoy conversation--however, I do love my down/privacy time, so that I understand those travelers that need to enjoy their private vacation.  My general style of greeting is a warm gentle handshake or a cheerful hello---not really a hug type of person, but very warm and enthusiastic to greet you and make you feel at home:)",50%,f,Mission Terrace,1

I enjoy meeting new entrepreneurs and  business people as well as tourists and work hard to be sure everyone has a positive experience in my home.  My homes are in cities named by the Spanish for Saint Francis of Assisi:  San Francisco and Santa Fe  (Santa Fe's full name is  La Villa Real de la Santa F de San Francisco de As_s (The Royal Town of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of Assisi).My primary home is in Potrero Hill in San Francisco.  I love the home's gardens and fantastic views which you can see from five different patios or decks.  My guests enjoy the combination of luxury and elegance with comfortable charm.My other homes, primarily vacation homes, are in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where I grew up.  The two homes on Garcia St., in the Historic East Side of Santa Fe, are truly ""Santa Fe Style"" with vigas (ceiling beams), Kiva fireplace, wood floors and thick adobe walls.  The setting is spectacular in the heart of old Santa Fe with easy access to the museums, art, hiking trails, and plaza.    Case Ramona was my mother's home and is also in Santa Fe style with a wonderful yard and access to the trail system and amenities of the Park Plazas neighborhood. It is available for longer term rental.As you can see from my reviews, many first-time Airbnb guests have enjoyed my homes. If you are new to Airbnb (or not) and want to book one of my listings, please consider these 'pro tips' gleaned from my Airbnb experiences...both, as a host and as a guest:1) Be Verified and have a nice, clear photo of your face on your profile *before* sending a note/booking request to a host (trust and transparency are keys to success here).  As a woman it is especially important that I know who is staying at my home2) Read the Airbnb FAQs thoroughly! Hosts with popular listings are busy people and we appreciate it when prospective guests ask questions unique to their travel situation and/or the listing in question. 3) PLEASE thoroughly read through my listings. I assure you that your questions about parking, public transportation, check in/out, etc. have been included in the listings.4)  Tell me about yourself.  Since you may have few/no reviews, hosts like me must make a guess as to what sort of guest(s) you might be (and some hosts won't even consider people new to Airbnb). In the absence of a review, you might consider the following to ensure I (other hosts) will feel comfortable approving your request: in your initial note, it is appreciated when you include what your plans are during your stay (sightseeing, attending a conference, partying at clubs, etc)  include assuring comments about how you will treat my home (i.e. ""I will treat your home with the same respect I treat mine"")  let me know you've read the house rules, and that they are agreeable to you (this is a must, please)5) Finally...I, like other busy hosts, keep my calendar up to date! So, if Airbnb is showing my listings as available for your dates - the place is available! If my listing suits your needs, it is best to send the booking request right off. If you hesitate, the other person looking at my place for your dates will get it!Hope this is helpful. Welcome!",100%,t,Potrero Hill,8

We invite you to stay with us in our 1896 Edwardian home in the middle of the Mission District, San Francisco's oldest and arguably most vibrant neighborhood filled with a diverse range of some of the City's best restaurants, bars, parks, shops, and more. Not to mention our neighborhood is the warmest, flattest, and fog free part of San Francisco. Our twin daughters (age 12) are as delightful as they are cute, funny, smart, and entertaining. They love having guests from around the world.  The girls are in bed quite early so you are unlikely to hear them after 8 PM in the evenings but you may hear the pitter patter of small feet on the mornings before they leave for school at 8:20 AM.  We're 15 minutes from SFO by taxi, a block and a half from the 24th Bart Station and close to many bus and MUNI (subway) lines. Having visited Southeast Asia, Oceania, Europe, Central America, and of course North America, one theme holds true for all our adventures: discover the true culture and flavor wherever we are. As your host, we'll do everything we can to make sure you get off the beaten path. We're happy to share our favorite restaurants, local hangouts, and ensure you see the true San Francisco, not just the typical touristy sites. We're into everything from biking, kayaking, hiking, wine, art, music, food, festivals, museums, all things kids, parks, and more. Whatever you're into, we'll point you in the right direction so you have an authentic and memorable time in San Francisco. My motto is from the great Mahatma Ghandi: ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" Our style of hosting reflects the needs of our guests. Whenever possible, we like to meet our guests. However we understand that many of them are busy on a tight schedule or not interested to meet us so we respect that. We want to make sure every guest is comfortable and part of that is respecting boundaries and their personal space. We look forward to hosting you soon! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. We're just a click away. ",100%,f,Mission District,2

Enjoy your time in San Francisco....the best city in America!  As a Guest, I am mindful that you are offering up your private domain and will treat you/your home with the utmost respect.  When I travel, I enjoy staying amongst locals; which is why I prefer airbnb over hotels  & hostels.  Thank you for offering your home to visitors! ->New airbnb Guests, please read below:As you can see from my reviews, lots of first time airbnb guests have enjoyed a positive first experience at my home.  If you are new to homesharing (or not) and want to book one of my listings, please consider these 'pro tips' gleaned from my many airbnb experiences...both, as a host and as a guest:1)  make sure you are completely verified and have a nice, clear photo of your face on your profile *before* sending a note/booking request to a host (trust and transparency are paramount, for both, host and guest);2)  read through the airbnb FAQs thoroughly!  Hosts with popular listings are busy people and we appreciate it when prospective guests ask questions unique to their travel situation and/or the listing in question.  We appreciate less those that ask us general airbnb questions that are answered already in the FAQs;3)  please, please, please thoroughly read through my listing(s).  I assure you that your questions about parking, public transportation, check in/out, etc. is already included in the listing(s);4)  since you may have few/no reviews, hosts like me must make a guess as to what sort of guest(s) you might be (and some hosts won't even consider people new to airbnb).  In the absence of a review, you might consider the following to ensure I (other hosts) will feel comfortable approving your request:  in your initial note, it is appreciated when you include what your plans are during your stay (sightseeing, attending a conference, partying at clubs, etc)  include assuring comments about how you will treat the host's home (i.e. ""I will treat your home with the same respect I treat mine"")  please make sure you've carefully thought out how you will feel about sharing your space (and sole bathroom, in my case) with a complete (male) stranger.  This is a shared living situation and quite different (better!) than a traditional hotel room stay  get another airbnb member to write a reference on your behalf (click on 'reviews/references' on your profile page and you will see how to do that; this is a 'nice-to-have' thing)- MOST IMPORTANTLY -  **make sure to read the listing 'House Rules' and let the host know that they fit with your needs/lifestyle (this is a must for me, please)5)  airbnb no longer allows for third-party bookings (so, no..you may not book for your mum, sister, bff, etc).  Here is airbnb's policy statement around this:  https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/4276)  For international guests - please make sure you have your smartphone connectivity sorted out for your stay in America.  USA phone networks are not very flexible so it is advised you check on text/data options *before* your trip.  At very least, install Whats App on your phone (like SMS and freely usable over data/wifi connection).  Being able to communicate with me/other hosts on your day of arrival is crucial...especially if such things as a lockbox, or other unattended key transfer is used.7)  Finally...I, like other busy hosts, keep my calendar up to date.  So, if airbnb is showing either of my listings as available for your dates - the place is available!  If my listing suits your needs, it is best to send the booking request right off.  If you hesitate, the other person looking at my place for your dates will get it!Hope this is helpful.  Welcome to my home.",N/A,t,Western Addition/NOPA,1

I started traveling with my parents when I was a kid; my mom and dad still tell me about how ecstatic I was when we boarded the sleeping carriage of the train that took us to Transylvania when I was three. Later I traveled with friends or by myself, and visited many places in South-East Asia, which I immediately fell in love with. On these trips I crossed the vast lands of Rajasthan in an Indian sleeping carriage, sailed the Indonesian Ocean with a ferry under the night sky, and slept in stone lodges along trails in the Himalayas. When my brother and I were growing up, every summer we visited a new country, climbed a new mountain, or discovered a new beach, by driving across Europe in our car. Back in those years, we were part of a home sharing organization that published listings from all over the world in a giant, phone registry size book. Those were times before the internet, social media and e-mails.. the only way to contact another family was to give them a call (on their land line) or write a letter! It worked perfectly and we exchanged homes with families from a number of countries: they stayed at our home while we stayed at theirs. The system was built on trust and a combined desire to share and to travel. Chris - I started traveling by myself when I was about 10. I just got on a plane after my mom made a few arrangements on the other end. Off I went to Europe stopping wherever the frequent flyer mile tickets required. It was epic! I tasted ""Belgian Fries"" in Brussels, slept on the train from Amsterdam to Vienna, took the hydrofoil on the Danube to Budapest... whatever was inexpensive and available, and there was no hurry to get anywhere. Now I've started the next journey with Agi, renting out our places here and in Budapest, and expanding the travel experiences to others.  We hope you come stay with us and experience San Francisco or Budapest, my two favorite cities... along with Bangkok, Barcelona, Rome, Berlin, Tulum, London, actually I can't list them all. Airbnb is the new generation of home sharing and we're excited to be part of it!

9788835,Bonnie,11/3/13,"San Francisco, California, United States","I began hosting with Airbnb in March 2013.  It's been interesting and mostly enjoyable meeting so many different people from different countries.  I love that most people that come to San Francisco are surprised at how friendly people are here and how willing they are to help.  I went to New Zealand a few years ago and was surprised to find that people were more reserved and a bit more guarded, less open.  So I am learning things from people that I did not put together until I hosted.   It's fun to hear other people's perceptions of Americans and see their opinions change a little.  I have two border collies - one 14 and one 7.  They are very friendly and love people but after their initial greet are very calm.  San Francisco is very dog friendly and we walk a lot (off leash).  I have 60 + acres of woods behind my house used for hiking and mountain biking, which is quiet and we love walking up there.  It is property owned by UCSF and open to the public.  I love animals of all kinds, but would especially love to add a couple of chickens to cluck around outside.  But I would have to first figure out how to protect them from nocturnal predators.  Typically you don't see them, but we have coyotes, skunks, and raccoons.  My dogs know they are there more than me.  Personally, I guess I am a work in progress, still trying to figure out where I would love to live if I were to move...maybe where I could garden more and have more animals.  Some place relaxing, preferably with a creek running through...but at the same time a place that is multi-cultural.  I am easy going and relaxed and don't stress too much over little things.  Sometimes people that feel entitled drive me a little nuts.  But I'm trying to learn to ignore them.  I don't really have many hobbies anymore.  I'm kind of a work in progress, realizing there is so much out there to do and learn.  Hosting has made me want to see more and do more.  I traveled a lot when I was younger and am content to just think maybe doing a bit more of it soon.  When people stay here from other countries I like to find out more about their culture and where they are situated geographically.  I am learning from all of this and it's been mostly good.  ",100%,t,Inner Sunset,1

Since August of 2015, I have had over 65 reviews from guests that either rented my entire house or just my extra bedroom.  Out of those 65 different guests, I would host almost all of them again.  Many of my guests often stay in touch now through the wonderful world of (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) or when they come to the city again.  I have only had one negative review out of 65 and no matter what I did it was going to probably be negative.  I hope the other 99% of my reviews give you an indicator of the type of host I am and how serious I take each and every reservation I have. It has been a great experience for me and one  that I never thought would have provided the amount of gratitude I receive from hosting on a weekly basis.If you decide to choose a stay with me, I can promise that I will give you the utmost of respect as I hope you would afford me.  I am a great guy who has built a world around him surrounded by a lot of love, kindness, and genuine people. By they way, I welcome our LGBTQ friends always. Let me show you the warmth and comfort of this magical city!  Upon arriving you will have my own personal guest book that has maps, brochures, and a list of must-see attractions in San Francisco broken down by each neighborhood in the city.  My house is located in the  Outer Sunset by Ocean Beach and GG park and is not in the heart of the madness of the inner city but rather the quiet solitude of San Francisco's Outer Sunset.  I look forward to meeting you and getting to know you!Sincerely,Bill ",100%,t,Outer Sunset,2

Eight years later he was ordained losangmonlam, a monk of the Tibetan Buddhist monastic tradition by Choden Rinpoche in California; later taking full ordination with His Holiness Dalai Lama in a ceremony held at his temple in Dharamsala.losangmonlam continued to practice. study and teach in the San Francisco Bay Area, under the guidance of Geshe Ngawang Dakpa. During this same period he also studied and practiced at Sera Jey Monastery, a University for Advanced Buddhist Studies and Practice, in Bylakuppe, South India.In 1998, he started the Tsa Tsa StudioCenter for Tibetan Sacred Art in 1998 combining his work as an artist with his spiritual practice, creating walls of Buddha images and other commissioned installations.Blase wasn't born to any of this.The first years of his life was shared with his family of five brothers in a farming community on the edge of the Red River Valley in North Dakota.Graduating high school in southeastern Minnesota he went on to receive his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. And, not until he was just shy of finishing his M.B.A Degree at Boston University, did he finally honor his inner quest to seek answers. His journey began by traveling the world to connect with a wide range of people from all walks of life and traditions.Three years later, blase returned to the United States having discovered, among many other things, his considerable talent and joy at being an artist - a painter and sculptor. It was as an artist he presented himself to His Holiness the Dalai Lama on a later trip of exploration.His art in the field of video installation included shows in the Bay Area in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He also contributed his visual skills as an artist in the area of graphic design at this time.

I am from Mexico and I am a retired Naval Officer.I work in an Internet Startup here in the city. I am also quiet (at the beginning), polite, decent, serious, athletic, clean, organized and 33 years old. I moved to the Bay Area about two years ago. My goal was to live in San Francisco and after struggling for about a year I finally made to locate myself in the city in the great Marina district. I recently started to host guest in some of the apartments that I happen to manage in the wonderful city of San Francisco. The rooms that I have been offering are in great location and will give you the chance to experience total different neighborhoods with the same host: The Marina and the Mission districts. -One is very relaxing, very quiet and with super close to the Golden Gate Bridge.-The other one in the heart of the art and excellent nightlife of the latin neighborhood. It was hard to decide in which one I would be living since I like them both... but I finally chose the first one. My own apartment is located in the Marina district since I like the waterfront and the amazing views of the bridge close to where I live. Don't get me wrong, I still go to the Mission and its nightlife every now and then. But I leave that to the younger souls. (Not that I am that old, LOL)As you can see from my reviews, many first-time Airbnb guests have experienced and enjoyed how my little business has been growing in my rooms. Though I still have a lot to improve in this matter. I appreciate every single review and feedback that you have. I often prefer to have the bad reviews spoken in person, because when it is something that can be changed I would do it right away; whereas the bad review in the room, does not allow me to get rid of it when I improve it or change the issue. If you are new to Airbnb (or not) and want to book one of my listings, please consider these tips from my Airbnb experiences1) Be Verified and have a nice, clear photo of your face on your profile. It has been difficult something to provide accurate information to my guests when they happen to have a photo when there are more than just you. 2) Read the Airbnb FAQs thoroughly! Hosts with popular listings are busy people and I would appreciate it when prospective guests ask questions unique to their travel situation and/or the listing in question.3) PLEASE thoroughly read through my listings. I assure you that your questions about parking, public transportation, check in/out, etc. have been included in the listings. If not, you can always tell me to add it or if just something was not clear enough. I am here to help you.4) Tell me about yourself. Since you may have few/no reviews, hosts like me must make a guess as to what sort of guest(s) you might be (and some hosts won't even consider people new to Airbnb). In the absence of a review, you might consider the following to ensure I will feel comfortable approving your request: in your initial note, it is appreciated when you include what your plans are during your stay (sightseeing, attending a conference, partying at clubs, etc)  let me know you've read the house rules, and that they are agreeable to you (this is a must, please)5) Finally...I, like other busy hosts, keep my calendar up to date! So, if Airbnb is showing my listings as available for your dates - the place is available! If my listing suits your needs, it is best to send the booking request right off. If you hesitate, the other person looking at my place for your dates will get it!Hope this is helpful. Bienvenido a casa!",100%,f,Cow Hollow,5

This has been my full time home these past 25 years. In 1960 after college (University of Iowa) I moved to Sacramento, California.  I have lived in San Francisco full-time since 1974. I am an avid fan of motorcycles -- cycles were my primary transport rain or shine all of my adult life. I still run to the windows when the rumble of motorcycles go by. Regretfully I have switched to pedestrian mode these past 5 years... thus I can give you many walking tips in our changing SOMA neighborhood.Work wise I was a TV news photo cameraman at KRON/NBC in San Francisco for 26 years. Born Minneapolis followed by Phoenix, Sacramento, Pullman, WA, NYC, Seattle, and now San Francisco. I've traveled through most of the U.S. -- often times on motorcycle. I've done some International travels for works and holidays: London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris, Hong Kong, Beijing, Tokyo and Manila.I founded the Stompers Boot shop in 1996 which was located in the first floor of my building. I sold the boot shop in 2011. The current owners have closed the store and have relocated to Florida.  I have no ties with the current Stompers ownership.I occupy this 3 bedroom second floor apartment with my very good friend and roommate Jimy and our miniature schnauzer dog ""Emit."" With my retirement and good health, I'm enjoying these golden-years in San Francisco.  A city that reflects my values, that feeds into my thirst for knowledge and my lust for life. My AIRBNB part-time hosting is stimulated with the wide variety of guests checking-in to our home from all parts of the world! The other parts of my daily life is keeping connected with friends, family.... exploring the nooks and corners of this SOMA neighborhood while walking our dog, Emit.  A very exciting current project is archiving the thousands of photos being digitized and organized for a legacy website from my motorcycle riding years and hundreds of images from my boot shop ownership.FAVORITE QUOTES ""In the end, only three things matter: how much you loved, how gently you lived, and how gracefully you let go of things not meant for you.""

We also loved to ski, snowboard, and go backpacking.  With two little ones, we stay close to home and enjoy all the great things our neighborhood, city, and region have to offer.  Our favorite travel destination these days is our annual trip to the coast of Maine to visit family and to relax.      ",100%,f,Inner Sunset,1

43707666,Linda,9/8/15,"San Francisco, California, United States","ABOUT MEI grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and became an exchange student at the age of 16. Living abroad for one year in South Africa changed my life forever. I since went back to live in South Africa a second time. I have had the good fortune of traveling abroad and meeting amazing people along the way. I met a woman on a train who invited me to visit her in Paris. When I got there, she gave me the keys to her apartment and said I could stay as long as I like. From that moment on I made a vow to help as many travelers as possible on their journeys. That is why Air BNB appeals to me; the art of travel, connection, culture, and sharing the City I love so very much with others.INTERESTSSpiritual pursuits. Traditional Japanese culture. Tea. Gardening. Reading/listening to books. Taking care of my backyard wildlife. Exploring San Francisco. Cooking, when I have the time to enjoy it. I am passionate about Languages and learning. I am fluent in English, learning Spanish and Japanese, and previously studied Indo-Malay. I am enthusiastic about collecting words and phrases in other languages. I am passionate about animals and nature.FAVORITE MUSIC, MOVIES & BOOKSI love music and enjoy anything from Classical to Funk, R & B, Motown, Beatles, Classic Rock, Blues, Pop, New Age, Country, just about anything, although I am not as well versed in Hip Hop.Shawshank Redemption, West Side Story . . . there are so many movies I love; it just depends on my mood. I typically watch inspirational movies, true stories, documentaries, romance, dramas, period movies, martial arts, and animation. I prefer movies that are not overly violent. I have a sense of humor and loved the movie ""Under Cover Brother."" I like Tyler Perry movies.I read a lot of spiritual, inspiration, and business books. I enjoy Pema Chodron and often refer to The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. I recently read ""The Surrender Experiment,""The Glass Castle,""Your Brain at Work."" I listen to Audio Books constantly which is why I get through so many books.COUNTRIES IVE VISITEDJapan, Peru, South Africa, Malaysia, Thailand, Switzerland, France, Belgium, ItalyTRAVELING STYLE & HOSTINGI am an adventurous traveler. I prefer to do and see things the locals enjoy. I prefer not to travel in groups or take a cruise. I can be flexible and enjoy a range of accommodations and meals, but in general, I like to keep things simple. As a Host, however, I enjoy nurturing Guests and making sure they feel well cared for and even spoiled. My Guests enjoy my many versions of tea and also wicked bowls of popcorn! I have always been complimented on my eye for detail and desire to make even the ordinary feel special. From the lovely view, peaceful setting, and friendly outdoor animal visitors, to the manner in which I go out of my way to make things unique and fulfill requests, you can count on having a positive stay and look forward to a return visit to our beloved house on the hill in exciting San Francisco.",100%,t,Twin Peaks,1

I love all kinds of food, my favorite being sushi. :) The coolest places I traveled to was Venice, Italy, and Lake Bled, Slovenia. I am very easy going as a host, but I do like things to be kept somewhat tidy. Everything in my room I have worked hard to own, and I definitely ask that one is careful with my possessions. My roommates may or may not be around, they are both around my age and are awesome. My life motto is to live every day like it's your last. I travel as much as I possibly can and love meeting new people from different cultures and different parts of the world. ",75%,f,Pacific Heights,3

Which isn't often enough for me when living so far away. But, I've left my heart in San Francisco. Actually I left home for boarding school at age 11 and then was living in NY studying at age 16. By the time I was 18 I was living in Paris and the company I was working for closed its doors after a year. So, at 19 I was pouring beer in a pub in London to survive. But, after a year and a string of events, I found myself here in wonderful San Francisco. I've been here ever sine 1997. With all the traveling and the moving, I realized that my living situation and surroundings really had a large impact on how I saw the entire city. I've returned to citied and stayed in different places and depending on wether it's a beautiful hotel room or a crappy room, thats pretty much how I saw most of that city. It's not about a cheap room, (unless its a lovey and nice cheap room) and doesn't matter because I'm not spending much time in the room. It is wonderful coming home at a lovely place, and start each morning from that lovely place for your daily adventures. My place here in San Francscio is really lovely. And because I believe that my place will be partly responsible with how your entire stay goes and how you will look at San Francisco, it was only natural and required I created a place that reflexts the city and its beauty. The aptment is tucked back off the main street  on the top 2nd floor. Runs down the side on a quiet lane call Germania st. There are many birds and tress surrounding the area. The apt is full of sunlight and a cross breeze due to the windowns on both sides of the apt. Giving you plenty of views and open space. Inside is a mix of historial molding and victorian archeteture and it feels welcoming and nice. You'll see SF as a place of warmth, cozy, spacious, contemporary and traditional. There is a great energy to this place. You don't wish you were in another space when here. It is smack middle of everything including surrounded by 4-5 most popular areas in town, such as Hayes vallet, Cole valley, Noe valley, h\Haight Ashbury area, and the Gay Castro district. You can walk just about anywhere in 15-20 mins. There is a train, bus, or street car 2 blocks in 3 directions. You couldn't ask for a better location. You can stand in the kitchen and watch the dogs running in the park across the street or sit on the back steps and watch the lights come up on twin peaks at sunset. It's really a beautiful, simple and lovely place. Hope to see you here and let this place provoke all the beauty San Francisco has to offer you. ",N/A,f,Duboce Triangle,1

We strive to create a comfortable environment where you can feel at home and escape from the Mission's busy streets. We LOVE this place, and we hope you do too!Guest AccessYou are welcome to use the kitchen and to keep food in the refrigerator and freezer if needed. We have a drip coffee maker for your use, electric tea kettle, toaster oven, microwave, gas range and oven. We provide high-speed wireless internet access at no additional charge. WiFi password should be unlocked w/in Airbnb site, but it can also be found on the fridge. We have no pets, but we welcome anyone with service animals. Interaction with GuestsWe go with the flow. Usually our schedules are busy working, we're out exploring the Mission or Bay Area.  Other times, we'll all hang out in the evening or weekend. When things work out, we've all gone out for dinner, a night on the town, or a walk to the Farmers' market on the weekend.The NeighborhoodEverything is easily accessible: restaurants, museums, waterfront, shopping -- plus so much more this amazing city has to offer. We're just a short walk to the Castro, Noe Valley, Bernal Heights, and all the nightlife of SoMa -- and just a 2 minute walk from BART. We're near enough of everything that it's easy to get around!San Francisco has some of the best food in the world, and we've got plenty of places to grab breakfast, lunch or dinner within just a block or two. Let us give you a recommendation to suit your tastes, or explore our local favorites.Getting AroundWe're only minutes walk from Muni, BART, and we're easily freeway-accessible if you're driving. (Parking is challenging so public transport is the way to go!) Uber and taxis are also an easy option. We have a parking space that is sometimes available- ask if needed. Other Things to Note-Our apartment is usually pretty quiet, some street noise, but nothing too heavy.   ",97%,f,Mission District,3

My native home was in the village of Smokvica - on the island of Korcula. Most of the population of Smokvica village is blood-related to me. When young I worked on diverse family farming duties for managing olives and wine grapes. My last adult employment there was as a receptionist in a resort hotel - a promotion from overnight room-cleansing services. My only Atlantic transit - Le Havre to New York - was via the Ile De France ocean liner. San Francisco's Potrero Hill neighborhood was my original U.S. destination because I had close relatives already living here. I am a gardener, cook, and I also enjoy following the San Francisco Giants. I appreciate past tenants who have been complimentary about my hospitality, the amenities, and the warm ambience. I am professionally disciplined by 5-star resort employment experience to provide a cleansed, thus healthy, household environment. During the remodeling extensive soundproofing of the home was  successful and the interior is now a place of stressless peace as insulated from most city/street noises. I like people, cats, dogs, orchids, and my 24-year companionship with a clever blue/gold macaw. I also feel fulfilled by seeing a body of water, San Francisco Bay, from my windows. Potrero Hill is legendary as the local ""garden spot"" of annual weather and is sheltered from most wind and fog that can occur within San Francisco. I feel fortunate to have lived the majority of my life here. I have also visited most of the national parks within the eleven western states with repeated trips to Southern California and Palm Springs.     ",100%,f,Potrero Hill,1

79259184,Richard,6/22/16,US,"As Wyndham Vacation Resort Presidential Reserve Platinum owners, we started acquiring points several years ago in preparation for retirement. Our plan was to rent out some of our time to help offset our maintenance fees just until we were able to travel. Our prices were fair and we found the demand to be incredible. It actually far exceeded our expectations. So after years of working for companies such as Wyndham Vacation Resorts, Hilton Grande Vacations and the Marriott Vacation Club, we decided to turn our knowledge of the industry into a full time business we call Vacation Strategy.We discovered that in these tough economic times people still want to travel, stay in nice places, spend quality time with their families, but they cant or dont want to pay exorbitant prices. Since starting the business, other opportunities have arisen allowing us to serve our customers even better. Several other Platinum and Presidential Reserve owners have asked us to help them in managing their accounts for rental of excess points. With hundreds of millions of points under management, we have even more opportunity to save you money on great accommodations, and allow you access to special inventories you simply wont find on Expedia, Orbitz or Travelocity.Our MissionVacation Strategy LLC, located in Celebration Florida, is a leading provider of resort vacation rentals serving well over 30,000 clients. We started in 2010 with a simple premise: That it was financially better to rent from a timeshare owner than to actually be a timeshare ownerHowever, renting from an existing owner presented its own challenges. It was very time consuming. Finding the right owners, hoping they had what you wanted, negotiating prices that were all over the board, and then hoping that they were reputable and could deliver what was promised. Frankly_ it was very risky and confusing. Our mission at Vacation Strategy is to bring order to the chaos, to eliminate the risk to our guests. We contract with hundreds of the largest timeshare property owners to bring you all the benefits of ownership with none of the headaches or hassles. The large timeshare giants dont like us very much_ but our clients love us! And at the end of the day, thats what matters.",88%,t,Downtown,23

I immediately fell in love with the City for its European feel, history, and most of all, its famous Painted Ladies. When I first moved here, I started to explore the Victorians on foot, taking long walks through our Pacific Heights neighborhood. I especially admired the Queen Anne's with their ornate details, stained glass windows, and turrets of a bygone era. I wondered how the craftsmen who made them did it. I found out soon enough.I walked by my home for years. It had fallen into disrepair. The paint was crumbling off, some of the windows had vines growing through the cracked panes and the stained glass windows were covered in dust. One day I saw a For Sale sign tucked in the weeds of the front yard. I chanced knocking on the door and the owner gave me a tour. I learned the home was built in the 1880s, after the Gold Rush and before the big quake. It needed a major restoration, which I suspected would be a daunting job. I wanted to do it, but needed a sign that I could take on the challenge. Ive always loved poppies, growing them back at home, and collecting china with poppy patterns. At the top of the stairs, I saw the sign I neededa stained glass window adorned with poppies. I spent the next year restoring this home. That was 15 years ago. In the meantime, I built a career in San Franciscos tech community, traveled the world, and restored a Pennsylvania farmhouse near where I grew up, where I have a barn dance every summer. I love to collect vintage beads and make my own line of jewelry.  Im new to Airbnb, and Ive enjoyed meeting people from all over the world, sharing my Queen Anne and its history with them. Im not always home, as I still travel for work and sometimes pleasure. But if Im here, youll most often see me in the garden, which I hope you will explore. Liz",100%,f,Pacific Heights,1

On my bucket list for places to visit are: Spain, Peru, Morocco, Cuba, Switzerland, Scotland, Vietman and Australia. Some of my favorite places I've traveled to are: Japan, Thailand, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands and New Zealand.
